* Goertzel Algorithm
The Goertzel algorithm is a method used to compute the Fourier transform value at a specific spectral bin.
The algorithm is widely used as a tone detector in dual tone multi-frequency systems (DTMF).
The Goertzel algorithm, named after its creator Gerald Goertzel, is used to efficiently detect a specific frequency component within a signal.
Unlike the more computation-ally demanding Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the Goertzel algorithm focuses on a predetermined frequency,
making it suitable for real-time applications with limited computational resources. Widely used in telecommunications, audio processing, and embedded systems, 
it offers a streamlined solution for targeted frequency analysis. The algorithm's simplicity and efficiency make it a valuable choice for scenarios where real-time 
processing and resource optimization are crucial.
